# VM-The-Art-of-Exploitation-2nd-Edition
[Hacking: The Art of Exploitation 2nd Edition](https://nostarch.com/hacking2.htm) is a very old book. So old, that the included LiveCD did not work in my machine or in a virtual machine. Granted, it did work on *some* of my other machines, but I don't like chances. 

And so, here resides the custom .vmx file [VMware Workstation Player](https://www.vmware.com/products/workstation-player.html) (Free). You install the software and the LiveCD iso from nostarch, put the iso in the same location as the .vmx, and you should be good to go. The .vmx file is not mine, and I don't remember exactly where it came from, but I do know that it was a pain in the ass to find.
